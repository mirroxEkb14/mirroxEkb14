## About me:eyes:
I'm a student from Kazakhstan [<img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72064941/144663082-afe18fae-1ff1-4a47-b1e3-6557980e45e6.png' alt='kz_icon' height='15'>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan) who is currently living and studying in Czech Republic [<img src='https://cdn.countryflags.com/thumbs/czech-republic/flag-waving-250.png' alt='cz_icon' height='10'>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic). At the present time I'm learning Czech to get into unversity and become an Android Developer. I started programming not a long time ago, I started with Pythonüêç but soon I understood that I was born to create mobile applications:grin: I mean, sitting all day at the computer trying to find a bug that can be fixed with one line of code? What could be better :D <br>

Programming is not the only thing I do but also in my free time I usually:
- learn languages:earth_americas:(not only the programming ones:smile:)
- read books:open_book:(I actually do it:nerd_face:)
- play guitar:guitar:

## I code with:keyboard:
